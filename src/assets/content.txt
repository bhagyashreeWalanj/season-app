 Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one
              of the four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks
              the transition from summer to winter, in September or March.
              Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes
              noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. 
              
              Winter
              Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate
              zones. It occurs between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's
              axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented
              away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as
              the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.
              
              Summer 
              
              Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons,
              occurring after spring and before autumn. At or aroundthe summer
              solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, daylight
              hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day length
              decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
